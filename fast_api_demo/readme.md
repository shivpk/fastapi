we have got the below exception while installing the fastapi:

Cargo, the Rust package manager, is not installed or is not on PATH. This package requires Rust and Cargo to compile extensions. Install it through the system's package manager or via https://rustup.rs/

to fix this, we have install the rust by below command:
```
    brew install rust
```
